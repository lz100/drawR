{drawR} is an interactive image editing tool that can be added as part of the HTML in Shiny,
R markdown or any type of HTML document. Often times, plots, photos are embedded
in the web application/file. {drawR} can take a screenshot of these image-like, or 
any part of the HTML document and send to a canvas-like workbench to allow users 
immediately edit the screenshot(s) within the same document. Users can quickly 
combine, compare different screenshots, their own images 
and maybe make a scientific figure.

## Features 

- {drawR} is built with 99% javascript + HTML + CSS, there is **no need to have a Shiny server** or any other 
types of server in the back-end. That's why you can use it in any HTML document. 
**All you need is a modern web browser**, like Chrome or Firefox (IE will not work).

## About drawR
{drawR} is originally part of systemPipeShiny (SPS), the SPS Canvas functionality.
However, one cannot use it outside SPS framework and installing the whole SPS framework
is heavy. To benefit more people in their own apps/documents, we provide {drawR} as 
a separate package.
